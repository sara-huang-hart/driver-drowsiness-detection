# ðŸ“Œ Project Background  
Driver drowsiness detection is a type of technology used in vehicles that helps detect driver drowsiness. These systems help prevent fatigue-related accidents. Various technologies, such as steering pattern monitoring, vehicle position in lane monitoring, and driver face monitoring, are being used. This project aims to find the best deep learning model to detect drowsiness given a set of images.
