# 📌 Project Background  
Driver drowsiness detection is a type of technology used in vehicles that helps detect driver drowsiness. These systems help prevent fatigue-related accidents. Various technologies, such as steering pattern monitoring, vehicle position in lane monitoring, and driver face monitoring, are being used. This project aims to find the best deep learning model to detect drowsiness given an image [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/serenaraju/yawn-eye-dataset-new).

# 🧐 Data Overview  
This dataset contains 2900 images, each in one of the following categories:  
- eye opened
- eye closed
- person yawning
- person not yawning  

The outcome variable is binary (1 for drowsy and 0 for non-drowsy). Images in the "eye opened" or "person not yawning" groups are non-drowsy, whereas images in the "eye closed" or "person yawning" groups are drowsy.
